# Indoor-navigation
The project focuses on helping users navigate in an indoor environment. 
The user takes a picture of her current location and the user's location is predicted using ORB (Oriented fast and rotated brief) model. Once the users location is predicted she is allowed to select a destination location and the shortest path from the users location to the destination location is found using GNN. 
The size of the dataset is around 2000 images. The dataset was built by clicking pictures from different viewpoints from various locations on campus.
